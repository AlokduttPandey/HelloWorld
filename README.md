# HelloWorld
My first repository on GitHub to store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

I'm an alien in a human's body and I'm here to fill the world with codes. Codes of eternal love, humanity and eternity. I just didn't know what to type in this edit. So, I'm just blabber-typing stuff. Please don't mind. :P :D :)
